Description: Bootstrap-enhanced website for Homework 4. I greatly improved
the navigation bar and made it mobile-friendly using Bootstrap's navigation bar.
I chose the dark theme to better match my website. When small, the navigation
bar becomes a drop-down burger icon. I added emojis and improved the
way that images display by using image-fluid. I changed the lists for parks to be
striped tables and added additional information about each park (year opened and size
in acres). I added carousels of images to the "Video Games" section and the
"Music Section". The Music Section, which is new, also includes a list of
favorite songs displayed as a striped table, showing the song title, artist, album,
and year of release. I added a picture of the costume I am currently trying to
make to the "sewing" section. I altered the footer to include a "Thanks for
visiting my website" message and added links to Handshake and Github. I used
Bootstrap's rows and columns system to ensure that the footer will look nice
on mobile screens as well as larger screens. In general, the content of the
website is now much better organized and is able to display properly on screens
of all sizes. The use of containers and jumbotrons allowed me to more clearly
split up my content. I added two new articles to my "School and Work" section,
"Coursework" and "Skills", both of which are organized using headings and
bullet points. I also used Bootstrap's rows and columns system to ensure that
the three articles would remain readable on smaller devices.
