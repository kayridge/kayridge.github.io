<!-- Description: Bootstrap-enhanced website for Homework 4. I greatly improved
the navigation bar and made it mobile-friendly using Bootstrap's navigation bar.
I chose the dark theme to better match my website. When small, the navigation
bar becomes a drop-down burger icon. I added emojis and improved the
way that images display by using image-fluid. I changed the lists for parks to be
striped tables and added additional information about each park (year opened and size
in acres). I added carousels of images to the "Video Games" section and the
"Music Section". The Music Section, which is new, also includes a list of
favorite songs displayed as a striped table, showing the song title, artist, album,
and year of release. I added a picture of the costume I am currently trying to
make to the "sewing" section. I altered the footer to include a "Thanks for
visiting my website" message and added links to Handshake and Github. I used
Bootstrap's rows and columns system to ensure that the footer will look nice
on mobile screens as well as larger screens. In general, the content of the
website is now much better organized and is able to display properly on screens
of all sizes. The use of containers and jumbotrons allowed me to more clearly
split up my content. I added two new articles to my "School and Work" section,
"Coursework" and "Skills", both of which are organized using headings and
bullet points. I also used Bootstrap's rows and columns system to ensure that
the three articles would remain readable on smaller devices.  -->

        <!-- New and improved navigation bar. Code altered from Boostrap
        website's example for navbar:
        https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/
        This is better than my previous navigation system because when the page
        shrinks, the navigation bar is still accessible through a drop-down
        menu, which is opened by a button. This navigation bar also has a 'brand'
        whereas the previous one did not. I used this to indicate what the
        navigation bar is for. The links lead to their respective
        homework assignments. The bar now sits at the top of the page and
        disappears if the user scrolls. This is much better for the "mobile
        first" approach associated with Bootstrapw. Having the navigation bar
        be at the very top of the page and stay there allows more room for
        content and makes the page feel less cramped. -->

                    to my general computer science curriculum, I have studied mobile
                    application programming. I am currently enrolled in COMP 4610, or
                    Graphic User Interface Programming I, which is the course for which
                    this website has been created. This website currently serves to
                    introduce myself, my experiences, my interests, and my ability
                    to utilize HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It also has a directory
                    for this course's homework assigments.

                        </h5>
                        During the summer of 2015, I worked as an intern at
                        Microsoft's Charlotte campus for six weeks. I was part of
                        a group of five students that were chosen to
                        participate in Microsoft's first internship program
                        for high school students outside of their main campus in
                        Redmond, Washington. I shadowed employees and assisted with
                        various tasks, such as repairing employee hardware and
                        upgrading laptops to Windows 10 from Windows 8. I also
                        assisted with Microsoft's annual "DigiGirlz" summer camp,
                        which aims to get more young women interested in STEM.
                        During my internship, I also practiced coding in Java and
                        created some very basic games using Unity and C#. I also
                        gained knowledge of culture in the workplace, such as
                        appropriate attire and behavior, expectations during
                        business meetings, event planning, and giving presentations.

            <h3> 🎮 Video Games 🕹️ </h3>
                <p>
                    Video games have been a favorite passtime of mine for my entire life.
                    As a child, I mainly played games on the Play Station 1, Play Station 2,
                    and Gameboy Advanced SP. Later on, I got into PC gaming and that is
                    how I play most of my games now, though I also have an XBox One and
                    a Nintendo 2DS. I have created a few video games myself. In high school,
                    I created a few very basic games using Scratch, Unity, and GameMaker.
                    More recently, I worked with a partner to develop a mobile game for
                    my Mobile Application Programming II course using Unity. Below is a
                    slideshow of the box art of four of my favorite games.

            <h3> 🌎 Foreign Languages 🇮🇹 </h3>
            <p>
                I have been interested in foreign languages and cultures from a
                young age. I have taken several courses in Spanish, German, and
                Italian. I am semi-fluent in Italian and can hold basic conversations
                in German. I don't remember much Spanish because I took it when I
                was very young, but I would like to re-learn it.
                I would also like to learn Norwegian, Japanese, and Russian.

             <h3>🎼 Music 🎶</h3>
             <p>
                 Like video games, music has consistenly been a large part of my life.
                 I have been playing the flute since 2010, and participated in both
                 concert band and marching band before starting college. I picked up
                 the Ukulele in summer of 2016 and can play a few songs on it as
                 long as I have sheet music, but am by no means great at it yet.
             </p>
             <p>
                 In addition to playing music, I also enjoy listening to it. Below
                 are a table of my favorite songs and a slideshow of the art for
                 some of my favorite albums.

            <h3> 🧵 Sewing 🧶 </h3>
            <p>
                I have always had an interest in sewing. My favorite things to sew
                are plushies and costumes. My current projects are sewing a costume
                of the character Ruby Rose from the series RWBY and teaching myself
                to crochet, both of which have been put on hold due to time constraints
                caused by school.
            </p>

                    The official concept art for the costume of the character that
                    I am currently working on. I started the project over the
                    summer and have been using this as one of my main reference images.
