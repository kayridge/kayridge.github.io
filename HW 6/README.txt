Description: The purpose of this assignment was to practice form
validation using jQuery. I modified HW5, which generated a multiplication
table and displayed errors at the bottom of the page. With the use of jQuery,
the error messages now disaplay under the field with the bad input instead of
by the submit button. This gives the user better feedback on what was wrong
with their input.
