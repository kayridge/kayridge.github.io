Description: The purpose of this assignment was to practice Javascript
for web development while also incorporating Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML. I
created a dynamic multiplication table whose factors come from user input.
The table is responsive so that it will be able to be viewed appropriately even
on small screens by using a scroll bar. The Javascript code checks for
errors in user input and displays appropriate error messages. If there are no
errors, a multiplication table is created using the user's input.
